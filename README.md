1949, in the wake of the bloodshed and eve of a new government, Tiananmen Square rings with Luo Lang's Funeral Dirge for all who fell in the Chinese Civil War.

40 years later wave of pro-Democracy movements throughout the 80s brought hundreds of thousands of students to Tiananmen Square in late April 1989, where the air was crisp with hopes to collaborate with the government.

//it felt like a party

But as the weeks went on chants and cheers were punctuated by the screams of ambulance sirens as hunger fasters collapsed. It became clear that the Chinese Communist Party were not prepared to engage.

//what am I feeling? I am angry, I am very angry

Until they did. In the early hours of June 4th, 250,000 soldiers were dispatched to the Square. A few hours later, they were instructed to shoot. Indiscriminately.

//it's a war, they're out to kill us, not to scare us

There is no official death toll, but thousands of bodies were dragged out of the Square in an efficient clean up procedure following the massacre.

//we were so young but we experienced such a violent killing... the killing of our peers

Today, the Tiananmen Massacre is blacklisted in China, and memories of the carnage are slowly fading.

//we were not allowed to openly shed a tear or light a candle for the dead, and we carry this wound, this open wound till today

These students did not die, but were erased from existence and history.

//and we are still not allowed to talk about it


This is the Funeral Dirge for them.
